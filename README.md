## My Library: simple-qr
My name: Jacob Suarez

For this exploration I looked at simple-qr, a library that allows you to generate QR codes from any string you input. As the name implies, simple-qr is very simple to use. All you need to input is the string you want turned into a QR code, the filename of the image output, and the size of the QR code. I made a simple function just so I wouldn't need to type #:module_width every single time I wanted to make a QR code of a size besides the default size of 5, then I made a bunch of test QR codes.
