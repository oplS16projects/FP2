## My Library: graphics/turtle
My name: Patrick Donegan

I worked with the graphics/turtle library to draw shapes.
The following code drew a square and triangle which shared a side.
Note that 1.414 is my approximation for root 2.
```
(define (square x)
  (draw x)
  (turn 90)
  (draw x)
  (turn 90)
  (draw x)
  (turn 90)
  (draw x)
  (turn 90)
  (move x)
  )

(define (triangle x)
  (draw x)
  (turn 135)
  (draw (* 1.414 x))
  (move x)
  )

(square 100)
(triangle 100)

```
This produced the following output

Another more interesting image that I created came about by mistake.
When I made a programming error which led to an infinite loop I stopped it
about 5 minutes in and this is the image that was created

The code that created this interesting image was the following

```
;(define (square x)
;  (draw x)
;  (turn 90)
;  (draw x)
;  (turn 90)
;  (draw x)
;  (turn 90)
;  (draw x)
;  (turn 90)
;  (move x)
;  (square (- x 10))
;  )
;
;(square 100)
```
