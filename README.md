# Final Project Assignment 2: Exploration (FP2)

##Part 1: Try a Library
I have used (web-server/insta) library for FP2

##Part 2: Write your Report
#### My Library: (web-server/insta)
My name: Udit Bhansali

At first I started working on (htmlPrag) library, but later I found out the library I'm using is obsolete. I later switched to (web-server/insta) library. This language is designed for writing simple web servers as per https://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server/run.html. I plan on adding a static list of posts on the web page.
