#TURTLES
**-ALEXANDER CUSHING**

Idecided to do something involving graphics for this exploration
I went with the turtles library and made a cool
graphic using the functions in that libray

my code is as follows:

```racket
#lang racket

(require graphics/turtles)
(require graphics/turtle-examples)
(turtles #t)


;;for this exploration I wanted to explore something more graphical
;;I put in a specific pattern of the turle functions
;;to display a cool "pattern turtle"
(neato)
(gapped-lines)
(neato)
(gapped-lines)
(neato)
```

here is the output:
