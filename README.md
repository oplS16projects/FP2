Josh Blanchette's FP2 report.

START

Hello. I used a plot library, and messed around with certain plots and shapes to see what I can produce.  At first, I just made a simple plot, just to get the feel of things.  The picture is below.

After I produced this graph successfully, I then got into more complex looking graphs.  I made a 'contour' graph, that required a simple inline lambda function.  This produced a, funky looking graph that has no relevance to data that matters, but it was still fun to play with.  The picture is below.

And here is the code sinppet.

```
(plot (contours (Î» (x y) (- (sqr x) (sqr y)))
                  -4 2 -4 2 #:label "z"))
```

Lastly, I produced a graph that has multiple plot points on it.  The image is below

And here is the code snippet.

```
(plot (list (function sqr 0 30)
              (point-label (vector 22 22))
              (point-label (vector 22 240))
              (point-label (vector 22 420))))
```

The code was pretty straightforward, where as the syntax was easy to understand.  If I had some valuable data to graph, this library would be very useful.  I also learened that once the graph is produced, you can zoom in and out of sections in the graph.  Pretty cool.
